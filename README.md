This exercise shows how to calculate the price of
a train ticket based on age and km traveled using JS.

Steps:
1.Ask the passenger its age with a prompt.

2.Ask the passenger the kms it wants to travel with a prompt.

3.Calculate the amount the passenger needs to pay,taking into
account if they are minors or over 65(in which case they'll have
a discount of 20% and 40% respectively)and the price per km(0.21).

4.Post the final amount on the page in a human-readable form(2 decimals max).

Thank you and have fun trying it out!!
